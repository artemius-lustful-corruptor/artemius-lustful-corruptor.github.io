                    <ul>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">Worked with ambiguity, taking abstract concepts and turning them into working software. In particular, I used Domain Driven Development (DDD) to make the software with ubiquitous language for business service providers to reduce miscommunication between developers and businesses.</li>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">Designed, developed, decomposition, and maintained Elixir-based applications with Phoenix for both internal and third-party systems, ensuring high performance, and maintainability code base. Correspondingly bugfix, refactoring, feature integration, and extensions of &#39;MobileID&#39; to resolve business requirements from service providers. As a result of this increased service providers&#39; users&#39; conversion through an easy authorization/authentication process via MobileID</li>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">Implemented best practices for test-driven development, continuous integration, deployment, and code reviews with development subsystems, utilizing Allure reports and Grafana dashboards to improve the testing, stats, deployment, and test coverage process. Also integrated, and deployed the Metabase to logs and stats aggregation for monitoring purposes. Which improved the working process for managers and support engineers.</li>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">Task decomposition and separation of business rules from code implementation. For example,  I changed the sub-system for logs metric from synchronous to asynchronous writing to InfluxDB. As a result, monitoring service stops to fall during sometimes network problems which improved business processes for service providers. In particular, making decisions about business processes based on metrics info in InfluxDB.</li>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">Added a proxy requests logic at the authorization/authentication pipeline at the aggregator system to the main Identity Gateway for all mobile operators in Russia. For example complex HTTP headers handlers and payload format to provide OpenID protocol for many IT solutions from the telecom industry. As a result, MobileID became a SaaS platform for all telecommunication providers in Russia.</li>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">Improved the tariffication with notification process at seamless authentication without user confirmation via phone. More specifically I integrated the notification process through a stored authorization session at Redis, accordingly checking MSISDN at notification to tarifficate all notifications. That increased service providers&#39; profit in comparison to tariffication only successful authorizations without notifications.</li>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">An improved working process with clients&#39; premium info data through implementing flexible options to proxy personal data (encryption, plain, encryption &#43; signed) from external providers. As a result, MobileID increased clients with different requirements for encryption and security.</li>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify business requirements and design solutions that meet those requirements, utilizing strong communication and interpersonal skills to foster productive relationships with stakeholders.</li>
