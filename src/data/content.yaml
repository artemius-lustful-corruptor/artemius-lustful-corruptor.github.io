Profile: I have been working as a backend engineer at Funbox company for 1 year. In this role, I provide bugfix, support and improvements in implementation of Mobile Connect protocol for our customers,  assisting with developing solutions to any concerns regarding system architecture and authorization process development. Before this, I held other lower-level software engineer roles for several years before earning my master’s degree and gaining developer experience, mostly on Elixir. Also sometimes I worked on Python and JS. At this stage in my career, I am ready to take on more challenging work as a Middle or Senior Elixir Developer and hone my technical skills as a Software Engineer and System Architect. I have started my work as an Elixir developer in summer 2019 in a small Russian company in a project, which is related to Insurance business. This is the mobile app which sells insurance policies to user’s rides and calculates user drive style and profile. I was a developer of several microservices and also trying my own leadership as a head of a small developer team. In January 2022 I changed my work. Till nowadays I worked as a developer at a Telecommunication company which supports its own implementation of Mobile Connect protocol. My responsibilities included bugfix and improvements of current realization and also development of new features. In those projects I  have gained experience of TDD and DDD methodology of development process, SOLID and Clean Architecture principles of complex software.
