Profile: I have been working as a backend engineer at Funbox company for 1 year. In this role, I provide bugfix, support and improvements in implementation of Mobile Connect protocol for our customers, assist in developing solutions to any concerns, regard system architecture and authorization process development. Before this, I held other lower-level software engineer roles for several years before earning my master’s degree and gaining developer experience, mostly on Elixir. Also sometimes I worked on Python and JS. At this stage of my career, I am ready to take more challenging work as a Middle or Senior Elixir Developer and hone my technical skills as a Software Engineer and System Architect. I started my work as an Elixir developer in summer 2019 in a small Russian company in a project, which is related to Insurance business. This is the mobile app which sells insurance policies to user’s rides and calculates user drive style and profile. I was a developer of several microservices and also tried my own leadership as a head of a small developer team. In January 2022 I changed my job. Till nowadays I have been working as a developer at a Telecommunication company. In those projects I  have gained experience of TDD and DDD methodology of development process, SOLID and clean architecture principles to build complex software with OTP and processes based approach. Where the purpose is to build Long-lived continuous processing systems with fault tolerance.
