Profile: <p> As an enthusiastic software engineer with six years of professional commercial development experience. With four years of experience as a Backend Engineer with Elixir/Phoenix and two years as a full-stack Web Developer with Python and VueJS, I have demonstrated the ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative software solutions. </p> 
 <p> I have a proven track record of success, having facilitated the development of the authorization system 'MobileID' through mobile phones via Mobile Connect protocol for MegaFon, one of the top telecommunication companies in Russia. Additionally, I was involved in the end-to-end development and release to production of an innovative mobile application 'Simble' for on-demand car and ride insurance. </p> 
 <p> With deep expertise in a processes-based approach, I excel in building long-lived continuous processing systems with fault tolerance. My comprehensive software creation and maintenance expertise has been applied in my work with FunBox and Sreda companies, where I have delivered successful solutions that meet business requirements. </p>
