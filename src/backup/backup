Profile: |
 <p> I am an enthusiastic and motivated software engineer with 6+ years of professional commercial working development experience. For most of that time I have worked as a Backend Engineer on Elixir/Phoenix, but I also had experience in Frontend Development for several years. In those projects, I have gained experience in TDD and DDD methodology of the development process, SOLID, and Clean Architecture principles to build complex software. Regards that working experience I have wide expertise in Elixir/Erlang/OTP and processes-based approach, where the purpose is to build Long-lived continuous processing systems with fault tolerance.</p>
 <p> At this stage of my career, I am ready to take on more challenging work to improve my technical skills as a Software Engineer and System Architect. I want to build reliable, secure, and scalable systems serving millions of parallel users, handling billions of transactions per day.</p>
 <p> I think that my ability to be a team player is at least as important as my ability to learn new things quickly and solve tricky problems, as is my passion for working with new technologies and finding joy in sharing what I've learned.</p>
