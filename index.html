        <p>I have been working as a backend engineer since the summer of 2019, mostly on Elixir. Before this, I worked in other lower-level software engineer roles for several years before earning my master’s degree and gaining developer experience. In those projects, I have gained experience in TDD and DDD methodology of the development process, SOLID, and clean architecture principles to build complex software. Regards that working experience I have wide expertise in Elixir/Erlang/OTP and processes-based approach, where the purpose is to build Long-lived continuous processing systems with fault tolerance. At this stage of my career, I am ready to take on more challenging work as a Middle or Senior Elixir Developer and improve my technical skills as a Software Engineer and System Architect. I think that my ability to be a team player is at least as important as my ability to learn new things quickly and solve tricky problems, as is my passion for working with Elixir/Erlang/OTP technology, and I want to build reliable, secure and scalable systems serving millions of parallel users, handling billions of transactions per day. Also, I am finding joy in sharing what I've learned.</p>

That server was architectured as multiple REST microservices which were developed mostly on Elixir/Phoenix but some of them use different technologies. In that project, I gained experience with AWS(Cognito, SNS), Firebase, APNS, GraphQL(absinthe), Kubernetes, Swagger, Broadway, Yandex Queues(AWS Queues), PostgreSQL, and Docker. Mostly the time I used Elixir/Phoenix but sometimes JS and Python for some applied tasks and also some YAML scripts for servers, charts, Gitlab-CI configuration, and deployments process.</li>

It was a project for calculating energy level, GPS, and other data for an electro-car. That data was displayed on the mobile phone. I worked on the server side which was developed in combination with Erlang and Elixir. It was an umbrella app with erlang dependency for working with EGTS protocol.</li>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">Created and led the development process of the microservice which aggregates car insurance offers from multiple insurance brokers.

                        <li class="experience__bullet">Created a microservice that generates PDFs for issued policies. That service is used by many Insurance companies which work with &#39;Simble&#39;. I combined solutions for rendering PDF with Python scripts with an Elixir server which collects and provide data through Erlang&#39;s binary port to python scripts and receives data for sending a response to the clients.</li>
                        
                        <li class="experience__bullet">Created the Push notification service which used APNS and Firebase to notify mobile clients about their insurance status. I used the Pigion library and GenServers to maintain the notification lifecycle.</li>
